# Sensitivities in Finance

This repository contains an implementation of Monte Carlo methods to estimate the sensitivities ("Greeks") of financial derivatives with respect to key model parameters. It explores three approaches - finite differences, pathwise derivatives, and the likelihood ratio method - to compute Delta, Vega, and Gamma under the Blackâ€“Scholes model. The analysis is partially based on [Monte Carlo Methods in Financial Engineering](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-21617-1) by Paul Glasserman.

The code was developed for the course "Stochastic Simulation" at EPFL in the academic year 2024-2025, fall semester.
